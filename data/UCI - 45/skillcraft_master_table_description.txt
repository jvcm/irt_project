Data Set Information:

-- We aggregated screen movements into screen-fixations using a Salvucci & Goldberg (2000) dispersion-threshold algorithm, and defined Perception Action Cycles (PACs) as fixations with at least one action. 
-- Time is recorded in terms of timestamps in the StarCraft 2 replay file. When the game is played on 'faster', 1 real-time second is equivalent to roughly 88.5 timestamps. 
-- List of possible game actions is discussed in Thompson, Blair, Chen, & Henrey (2013)

-- Skip league conditional inference forest classification (Bronze-Gold;Silver-Platinum;Gold-Diamond;Platinum-Masters;Diamond-Professional) showed changing patterns of variable importance with skill. 
-- Predicted attribute: League (Ordinal)
