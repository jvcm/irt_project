Data Set Information:

This data set measures the running time of a matrix-matrix product A*B = C, where all matrices have size 2048 x 2048, using a parameterizable SGEMM GPU kernel with 241600 possible parameter combinations. For each tested combination, 4 runs were performed and their results are reported as the 4 last columns. All times are measured in milliseconds*. 

There are 14 parameter, the first 10 are ordinal and can only take up to 4 different powers of two values, and the 4 last variables are binary. Out of 1327104 total parameter combinations, only 241600 are feasible (due to various kernel constraints). This data set contains the results for all these feasible combinations. 

The experiment was run on a desktop workstation running Ubuntu 16.04 Linux with an Intel Core i5 (3.5GHz), 16GB RAM, and a NVidia Geforce GTX 680 4GB GF580 GTX-1.5GB GPU. We use the 'gemm_fast' kernel from the automatic OpenCL kernel tuning library 'CLTune' ([Web Link]). 

* Note: for this kind of data sets it is usually better to work with the logarithm of the running times (see e.g. Falch and Elster, 'Machine learning-based auto-tuning for enhanced performance portability of OpenCL applications', 2015).
